# Snake-C

This project is an implementation of the classic Snake game in C++, with the visualizer based on a system terminal such as CMD or PowerShell.

## Overview

The Snake-C project brings the nostalgic Snake game to life in the C++ programming language. It aims to provide a fun and interactive experience, playable directly within the system terminal.

## How to Play

- Use the keys `W` (up), `A` (left), `S` (down), and `D` (right) to control the direction of the snake.
- Collect fruits (F) to increase your score.
- Avoid collisions with the snake's own body.
- Colliding with walls is disabled, allowing the snake to wrap around the screen.
